#Scrolling parallax effect
===================================
###### Updated: Thursday the 18th of January 2018.

### Overview
In this project, I'll be working on a parallax animation effect. The project currently needs to be tidied up and optimised.

### Requirements
To get the most out of this project, it is assumed that you already know how to do all of the following: 
- how to create HTML DIVs, classes, and ID's
- how to create responsive layouts using CSS
- how to write JavaScript
- how to recognise JavaScript errors using your browser's console

### Potential Resources
[Google hosted libraries](https://developers.google.com/speed/libraries/)
 provides a range of CDN's, including the latest version of jQuery.

[jquery.com](http://jquery.com/)
 provides excellent documentation about jQuery. There is also a section where you can find more information about 'no conflict' mode.

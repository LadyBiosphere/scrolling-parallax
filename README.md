#Scrolling parallax effect
===================================
###### Updated: Friday the 19th of January 2018.

### Overview
In this project, I put together some text and images to create a parallax effect similar to the one seen on the Firewatch website. Although it looks and feels the part, I think it can be optimised and tidied up further. For the sake of simplicity, I focused on the JavaScript and didn't invest a lot of time with the CSS or imagery; as a consequence of this, the web page that I've put together is loosely responsive and the images tile horizontally.

It's a good idea to think about and finalise your design before working on your parallax webpage.

### Requirements
To get the most out of this project, it is assumed that you already know how to do all of the following: 
- how to create, use, and export images from Adobe Photoshop, InkScape, GIMP or Adobe Illustrator layers 
- how to create HTML DIVs, classes, and ID's
- how to create responsive layouts using CSS
- how to write JavaScript
- how to recognise JavaScript errors using your browser's console

### Potential Resources
